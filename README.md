# Food-Ordering-App
In this project we have created a mobile application of online Food Ordering, we used Android as frontend and Spring boot as a backend.
# Connect Backend to Frontend
- To Connect Backend to Frontend change the "Base Url" in the StoreController.java to the "ip in which the Server runs".(in my case its "192.168.1.110");

- Change the Path of file.upload-dir in "smartmart/src/main/resources/application.properties" to the path of the images folder in the repo
